<p>My research area is Machine learning and Security. I have background in security and cryptography. I aslo have a math degree from UT that I learnt many encryption algorithm such as RSA and elliptic curve from.   </p>

<p>Three potential topics I would be interested in are:</p>
<p>(1) Machine Learning in Network Intrusion Detection</p>
<p>(2) Machine Learning in Malicious and spam email Detection</p>
<p>(3) Machine Learning in Authentication with Keystroke Dynamics</p>
<p>I have found a partner. Good Luck!</p>
